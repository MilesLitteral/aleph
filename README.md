AIO NeRF M/L Software

a Desktop Application with Cloud Functionality and capability, fully functioning (though in beta)
I built this to create a framework for full M/L Animation Synthesis, It's Front-End is written in Haskell
whilst it's backend is written entirely in python

I intend to make version of Aleph that is pure haskell at some point and deprecates all Python module with Haskell ones and vice-versa
(a version of Aleph that is pure Python)
